## Introduction

This project demonstrates a queuing system in JavaScript using Kue for job queuing and Redis for data storage. The tasks include creating jobs, processing jobs, testing job creation, and managing product stock and seat reservations using an Express server.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alx-backend.git
   cd alx-backend/0x03-queuing_system_in_js
Install dependencies:

sh
Copy code
npm install
Start Redis server (if not already running):

sh
Copy code
redis-server
Tasks Overview
7-job_creator.js
This script creates an array of jobs and pushes them to a Kue queue named push_notification_code_2.

Key Features:

Creates an array of jobs with phone numbers and messages.
Adds jobs to the queue and logs the job creation, completion, failure, and progress.
7-job_processor.js
This script processes jobs from the push_notification_code_2 queue.

Key Features:

Blacklists certain phone numbers.
Tracks job progress and logs the completion or failure of each job.
8-job.js
This script defines a function createPushNotificationsJobs that adds jobs to a Kue queue.

Key Features:

Validates the input to ensure it is an array.
Logs job creation, completion, failure, and progress.
8-job.test.js
This script contains tests for the createPushNotificationsJobs function.

Key Features:

Uses Kue's test mode to validate jobs in the queue.
Ensures proper error handling and job creation.
9-stock.js
This script sets up an Express server to manage product stock using Redis.

Key Features:

Lists available products.
Reserves stock for products.
Fetches the current stock of products.
100-seat.js
This script sets up an Express server to manage seat reservations using Redis and Kue.

Key Features:

Tracks available seats.
Handles seat reservations and queue processing.
Ensures reservations are blocked when no seats are available.
